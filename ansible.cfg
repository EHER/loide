# location of inventory file, eliminates need to specify -i

# the default number of forks (parallelism) to be used.  Usually you
# can crank this up.

# to an SSH timeout

# when using --poll or "poll:" in an ansible playbook, and not specifying
# an explicit poll interval, use this interval

# when specifying --sudo to /usr/bin/ansible or "sudo:" in a playbook,
# and not specifying "--sudo-user" or "sudo_user" respectively, sudo
# to this user account

# the following forces ansible to always ask for the sudo password (instead of having
# to add -K to the commandline). Or you can use the environment variable (ANSIBLE_ASK_SUDO_PASS)

# the following forces ansible to always ask for the ssh-password (-k)
# can also be set by the environment variable ANSIBLE_ASK_PASS

#ask_pass=True

transport=paramiko

# remote SSH port to be used when --port or "port:" or an equivalent inventory
# variable is not specified.

# if "user:" is not set in a playbook.  If not set, use the current Unix user
# as the default

# {file}, {host} and {uid} with template filename, host and owner respectively.

# time-formatting specifiers.
#
# Example: ansible_managed = DONT TOUCH {file}: call {uid} at {host} for changes
